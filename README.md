The major choice I made was if the player would choose to fight the Sith or attempt a diplomatic approach as they have different outcomes and paths to take depending on previous choices.

The pickup item is the Holocron as having it or not determines how certain aspects of the story play out and give different text entries depending on whether it is in the player's inventory.

The loop I used was the player needing to have visited the temple twice to confront the Sith so that it is not a straightforward one-and-done.
